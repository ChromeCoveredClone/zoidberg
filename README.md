hellloooooo!!! this profile is for the sole purpose of ponytown, nothing else (*unless there's some other website i'll get addicted to and it gives me the option to provide my github, then maaaybeeee...*)

any pronouns, by the way!! for all you know i could be a metal-bending robot or a helicopter... maybe a 10 year old kid sent to kong studios through a fedex crate. 

i loooove music!! i'd die withtout it, so here's my main favorite artists!!

- interpol, gorillaz, beck, daft punk, blur, the strokes, MGMT
